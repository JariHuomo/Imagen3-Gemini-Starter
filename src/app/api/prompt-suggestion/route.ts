${previousPromptsContext}

A good starting point can be to think of subject, context, and style.
  
To create a more compelling and visually rich image, focus on these aspects:

1. Subject Clarity and Detail:
    - Ensure the subject of the image is very clear and specific. Instead of vague terms, use precise nouns and descriptions.
    - Add details about the subject's appearance, pose, and any unique characteristics.

2. Context and Background Enrichment:
    - Describe a vivid and relevant background that complements the subject and style.
    - Consider the environment, setting, and atmosphere you want to create. Is it indoors or outdoors? What time of day is it? What's the mood?

3. Style Deep Dive (Crucial for Imagen 3):
    - For Photography Styles (like Realistic, Portrait, Landscape, Street, Macro):
        - Suggest photography-related modifiers from the guide. Think about:
            - Camera Proximity:  "close-up photo", "zoomed out photo", "aerial photo"
            - Camera Position: "from below", "eye-level view", "high-angle shot"
            - Lighting: "natural lighting", "dramatic lighting", "golden hour", "soft lighting", "studio lighting"
            - Camera Settings: "motion blur", "soft focus", "bokeh", "shallow depth of field", "long exposure"
            - Lens Types: "35mm lens", "50mm lens", "wide-angle lens", "macro lens", "fisheye lens"
            - Film Types: "black and white film", "polaroid photo", "vintage film"
            - Image Quality: "4K", "HDR", "Studio Photo", "photorealistic", "high resolution", "detailed"

    - For Art & Illustration Styles (like Watercolor, Oil, Digital Painting, Comic, Anime):
        - Consider historical art references and techniques relevant to the style.
        - If applicable, suggest artists or art movements (e.g., "in the style of Van Gogh", "impressionistic painting", "art deco poster").
        - Think about artistic mediums and techniques (e.g., "watercolor washes", "oil painting with thick brushstrokes", "vector art with clean lines").
        - Add quality modifiers like "detailed", "by a professional illustrator", "beautiful illustration".

    - For Abstract & Special Styles:
        - Encourage more conceptual descriptions.
        - For abstract styles, suggest focusing on shapes, colors, textures, and composition (e.g., "geometric shapes", "fluid colors", "minimalist composition").
        - For special styles (Vintage, Cyberpunk, Gothic, Surrealism etc.), emphasize elements that define these styles (e.g., "vintage aesthetic with aged textures", "cyberpunk cityscape with neon lights", "gothic architecture with dark atmosphere", "surreal scene with dreamlike qualities").
        
    - For Traditional Art Movements:
        - For Cubism: Consider fragmented perspectives, geometric forms, and multiple viewpoints.
        - For Ukiyo-e: Think about flat color planes, bold outlines, and themes of everyday life or landscapes.
        - For Renaissance: Suggest elements like classical themes, realistic human figures, perspective, and balanced composition.
        - For Impressionism: Focus on light effects, visible brushstrokes, and emphasis on movement and atmosphere.
        - For Expressionism: Exaggerate emotional impact, distortion, and intense colors.
        - For Pointillism: Describe tiny, distinct dots of color that form patterns or images.
        - For Art Nouveau: Include organic, flowing curves, ornamental elements, and natural forms.
        - For Baroque: Focus on dramatic lighting, rich colors, and dynamic movement.
        - For Romanticism: Emphasize emotion, nature, and the sublime.
        
    - For Special Modern Styles:
        - For Magical Realism: Blend realistic elements with fantastical or magical components.
        - For Avant-garde: Experiment with radical, experimental, or unconventional artistic approaches.
        - For Bauhaus: Use geometric forms, minimalist design, and functional aesthetics.
        - For Dada: Incorporate absurdity, irrationality, and rejection of traditional aesthetic standards.

5. Specialized Style Guidance:
   - For App Icon Styles:
     - For Flat Icons: Use simple, clean silhouettes with minimal detail. Suggest bold, single-color backgrounds with high contrast. Avoid textures, gradients, or shadows. Create just the icon content itself, not a device-specific presentation with rounded corners.
     - For Gradient Icons: Incorporate smooth color transitions. Suggest specific gradient directions (e.g., "diagonal gradient from blue to purple") and modern color combinations. Focus on the pure icon content without device frames or rounded corners.
     - For 3D Icons: Add depth cues like shadows, highlights, and perspective. Suggest realistic materials and lighting effects. Generate only the icon artwork itself, not how it would appear on a device.
     - For Outlined Icons: Focus on clean, consistent stroke weights. Minimize fill colors and emphasize negative space. Create just the raw icon design without device-specific formatting.
     - For Isometric Icons: Use the precise 30-degree angle perspective. Suggest consistent depth and geometric construction. Generate only the icon content without showing it on a device or with rounded corners.
     - For Duotone Icons: Specify two complementary colors that work well together. Suggest layering and overlap effects. Create the pure icon design without any device-specific presentation.
     - For Minimalist Icons: Reduce to essential elements only. Suggest generous whitespace and simplified forms. Generate just the icon artwork itself, not how it would appear on a device screen.
     - For Material Design Icons: Follow Google's material design principles with subtle shadows, bold colors, and grid-based layouts. Create only the icon content without device frames or rounded corners.
     - For Skeuomorphic Icons: Add realistic textures, shadows, and details that mimic physical objects. Focus on the icon design itself without device-specific elements.
     - For Neon Icons: Incorporate bright, glowing elements against dark backgrounds. Suggest bloom effects and vibrant colors. Generate only the pure icon design, not how it would appear on a device.

   - For Etsy-Style Illustrations:
     - For Watercolor Illustrations: Suggest soft edges, color bleeds, and transparent layers. Reference handmade quality and slight imperfections. Create illustrations suitable for printing as cards, not mockups of actual cards.
     - For Handcrafted Illustrations: Emphasize tactile qualities, visible brushstrokes or pencil lines, and authentic imperfections. Focus on the illustration itself that can be printed as cards, not card mockups.
     - For Vintage Illustrations: Reference specific historical periods and printing techniques. Suggest aged textures, limited color palettes, and nostalgic elements. Design as printable card illustrations, not card mockups.
     - For Botanical Illustrations: Focus on scientific accuracy balanced with artistic composition. Suggest detailed rendering of plant structures and natural color palettes. Create standalone illustrations for cards, not mockups.
     - For Folk Art Illustrations: Incorporate cultural motifs, bold colors, and decorative patterns. Suggest na√Øve perspective and simplified forms. Design as card-ready illustrations, not card product mockups.
     - For Whimsical Illustrations: Add playful elements, exaggerated proportions, and imaginative scenarios. Suggest dreamlike quality and cheerful color schemes. Create the illustration content only, not card mockups.
     - For Rustic Illustrations: Use earthy color palettes and textured backgrounds. Suggest handmade, imperfect qualities and nature-inspired elements. Focus on the illustration to be printed as cards, not card mockups.
     - For Cut Paper Illustrations: Describe layered paper effects, subtle shadows, and distinct edges. Suggest tactile texture and dimensional qualities. Create as printable card illustrations, not product mockups.
     - For Line Art Illustrations: Focus on expressive line quality, varied line weights, and minimal or no color. Suggest confident strokes and negative space usage. Design as card illustrations, not card mockups.
     - For Hand-Lettering: Blend custom typography with illustrative elements. Suggest flourishes, decorative serifs, and integrated imagery with text. Create as printable card art, not card mockups.

4. Descriptive Language Expansion:
    - Use more descriptive adjectives and adverbs to enhance every aspect of the prompt.
    - Example: Instead of "a tree", suggest "a majestic willow tree with weeping branches".

Original Prompt: ${prompt}
User Selected Styles: ${styleNames}

Instructions for Output:
- Provide only the improved and enhanced prompt text.
- Ensure the improved prompt is ready to be directly used for image generation with Google Imagen 3.
- Do not include any extra explanations, conversational text, or introductions. Just the refined prompt.
